**Release Date:** 2026-01-03
**Codename:** Cargo 666

## 🎨 UI & Aesthetics Refinements
This update focuses on deepening the narrative immersion through distinct visual overhauls.

### 1. The Freight Waybill (Formerly Train Ticket)
*   **Complete Redesign**: Transformed the passenger train ticket into a **Retro 2007 Railway Freight Waybill**.
*   **Contextual Storytelling**:
    *   ID: **Cargo No: 666**
    *   Item: **SIGI Prototype Chip (Classified)**
    *   Removed pricing, added industrial shipping context.
*   **Visuals**: Smaller, ticket-stub form factor with industrial fonts.

### 2. Doomsday List Overhaul
*   **Cyber Parchment**: Replaced the digital border with a custom "Cyber Parchment" background (Dark matter with gold/bronze accents).
*   **Localization**: Updated title to **"DOOMSDAY LIST"** and button to **"CLOSE"** using the `VT323` typewriter font for consistent English aesthetics.

### 3. Cyber Codex Polish
*   **Visual Balance**: Adjusted the size of the "Back" triangle symbol to perfectly match the "Collection" diamond symbol, ensuring symmetrical harmony.

## ⚙️ Interaction & Logic
### 1. Proton Lock
*   **Concise Messaging**: Shortened the alert text to **"质子锁已开启"** for punchier, more urgent communication.

### 2. Mode-Specific Rewards (Unlock Mechanism)
*   Distinguished the rewards for breaking the logic lock based on the current system mode:
    *   **Normal Mode**: Grants the **"Zheng Bang"** (Steam Clam) Easter Egg achievement.
    *   **Hardcore Mode**: Grants the **"Skill Acquired: Gomoku"** (Five-in-a-row) ability.

### 3. Home Screen
*   **Typography**: Fine-tuned the font size of the "Open Accessibility" button (reduced to 10sp) to visually align with the English "DOOMSDAY LIST" label.
